Last Update 12/19/2019 <br/>
Last Change: Added Frequency Analysis Tab<br/>

### Overview
This app allows the user to enter a Water Survey of Canada (WSC) station ID to access the Hydat database:
[Hydat Database](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/water-overview/quantity/monitoring/survey/data-products-services/national-archive-hydat.html)
<br/><br/>
The data can be summarized in tabular or graphical formats and flood frequency analysis (FFA) can be performed using various distributions.

Functionality in this ShinyApp is provided by [tidyhydat package](https://github.com/ropensci/tidyhydat). 
<br/>
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "10%"}
include_graphics("https://github.com/ropensci/tidyhydat/raw/master/man/figures/tidyhydat.png")
```
<br/>



### Usage:
Currently the app allows the user to:

- Load the Hydat database and download available streamflow and water level data
- View the locations of Water Survey of Canada (WSC) hydrometric stations (non-searchable map)  
- Select a hydrometric station and summarize streamflow data in a table format (daily, monthly, yearly) and download the selected format  
- View a hydrometric station historical daily hydrograph in an interactive graph  
- Run a Flood Frequency Analysis on the annual daily or instantaneous maximum streamflow series using various distributions  

<br/>

### Future updates

- Additional data summaries and graphs (likely added through using the [fasstr package](https://github.com/bcgov/fasstr) 
- Add statistical tests to assess best fit extreme frequency distributions
